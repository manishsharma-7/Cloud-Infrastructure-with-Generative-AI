## Introduction

- This solution uses the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) and Amazon Q to speed up the adoption of Infrastructure as Code (laC) to deploy applications and infrastructure in a repeatable manner.
- With the help of Amazon Q auto-suggestions, the infrastructure can be defined by using AWS CDK code constructs on integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Code Editor in Amazon SageMaker Studio, Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, and IntelliJ.
- AWS Toolkit and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials enable the AWS CDK and Amazon Q on IDEs.
- As the CDK code is written, Amazon Q provides suggestions based on comments and the context of the existing code.
- When the code is completed and tested, it is synthesized into an AWS CloudFormation template, which deploys the resources and applications that were defined in the CDK code.
- After all the AWS resources have been deployed and the application comes online, end users can begin accessing the application through the Application Load Balancer.
- The infrastructure can be modified with minimal impact by using the CDK to add or remove resources from the deployed CloudFormation templates.


### Step 1

1. In the top navigation bar search box, type:  
   `sagemaker ai`

### Step 10

1. In the bottom bash terminal window, at the command prompt, run:  

   ```bash
   mkdir cdkapp
   ```

   - You can also copy-paste this text. If you receive an undefined value when you paste this, try again. The code should look similar to what is displayed in the screenshot example.

2. In the left Explorer window, review to see that the `cdkapp` directory was created.
3. To change the directory to `cdkapp`, run:  

   ```bash
   cd cdkapp
   ```

4. To initialize the cdk process, run:  

   ```bash
   cdk init -a app -l=python
   ```

   - The "cdk init" command uses the name of the project folder to name various elements of the project, including classes, subfolders, and files. 
   - Using the "-a" option, you can specify an app name.
   - Using the "-l" option, you can specify the programming language.

5. Go to the next step.




### Step 11:
1. Review the cdk initialize process log and the virtual environment creation details.

- The ci_genai_stack.py contains the resources that you build in the next steps. You can use this file as a reference to check that all the resources are configured in your stack.
- The vpcapp.zip file contains the data and the files for a census application.
- The userdata.sh file includes the commands to install the dependencies and the commands for the application. It also loads data into Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS).

2. Choose the check box to select the userdata.sh file.
3. Click Copy S3 URI.

- You use this URI to download the userdata.sh file to the Code Editor IDE for deployment purposes.

4. Go to the next step.



### Step 15:
1. Return to the Code Editor IDE browser tab.
2. To change to the cdkapp subdirectory that was created by the cdk init process, in the bottom terminal window, run:

            cd cdkapp

- Note that a cdkapp subfolder exists within the cdkapp directory.

3. To download the userdata.sh file, replacing <userdata-uri> with the S3 URI that you just copied, run:

            aws s3 cp <userdata-uri> .

- Make sure to include the space and period (.) at the end of the command.

4. In the left Explorer window, click to expand the cdkapp directory.
5. Click to expand the cdkapp subfolder.
6. Open (double-click) the userdata.sh file.
7. Go to the next step.




### Step 16:
1. In the top userdata.sh window, review the file contents.

- This file contains the libraries to be downloaded for the census application to run on an EC2 instance.
- The vpcapp is the census application that displays the population values from different years and countries.
- The database_populate function connects to the Amazon RDS database (DB) cluster and creates a population table with the data.
- The application function starts the application.

2. Go to the next step.




### Step 17:
1. In the left Explorer window, open (double-click) the cdk.json file.
2. In the top cdk.json window, scroll down to the line that reads: 

            "@aws-cdk/aws-ec2:restrictDefaultSecurityGroup": true,

3. Change the "true" value to "false".

- The line should now read:
  
            "@aws-cdk/aws-ec2:restrictDefaultSecurityGroup": false,

4. In the left sidebar, click the menu icon to expand the menu.
5. Choose File, and then choose Save (not shown).

4. Go to the next step.





### Step 19:
- In the next steps, using Amazon Q suggestions, you define a stack with AWS CDK constructs to build a 3-tier web application. The application consists of an Application Load Balancer, an EC2 instance, and an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) DB instance that is deployed in a virtual private cloud (VPC).

1. In the top cdkapp_stack.py window, review the file contents.
2. In the bottom terminal window, to move up one level in the directory, run:

            cd ..

3. Go to the next step.



### Step 20:
1. In the top cdkapp_stack.py window, in the aws_cdk import block, delete the existing import values, and then copy-paste the following:

Duration,
Stack,
SecretValue,
aws_ec2 as ec2,
aws_rds as rds,
aws_iam as iam,
aws_elasticloadbalancingv2 as elbv2,

2. In the def init method, select (highlight) and delete the comments.
3. Go to the next step.




### Step 21:
- In the cdkapp_stack.py file, make sure to indent the newly added constructs to avoid errors in the deployment process.

- Make sure to properly close the constructs after adding the suggestions. Refer to the screenshots in the following steps for correct syntax and indentation, as AI generated code is not always 100% accurate.

- The resource names that you see might differ from the screenshot examples.
